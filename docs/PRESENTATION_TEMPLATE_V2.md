## 📋 What's New in v2.0?

### Enhanced Template Features

The presentation generation system has been **significantly upgraded** with professional-grade templates that ensure high-quality, export-ready slides.

---

## ✨ Key Improvements

### 1. **Strict Formatting Standards**

**Before:**
- Loose formatting guidelines
- Inconsistent slide separators
- Generic slide structure

**After:**
- **Mandatory format**: `# Slide N: [Title]` for every slide
- **Exact separator**: `---` (three dashes on own line)
- **Bullet point limit**: 5-10 words maximum
- **Slide count**: Always 10-15 slides

---

### 2. **Enhanced Slide Structure**

**New Required Structure:**

```
1. Title Slide - Compelling main title with subtitle
2. Agenda/Overview - 5 key topics to be covered
3. Content Slides (8-12) - One main idea per slide
4. Key Takeaways - 3-5 memorable insights
5. Next Steps/CTA - Clear action items
```

**Each Content Slide Now Includes:**
- Action-oriented descriptive title
- 3-5 concise bullet points (5-10 words each)
- Key insight statement (💡)
- Visual suggestion [Chart/Image/Diagram]

---

### 3. **Professional Content Guidelines**

✅ **DO:**
- Use numbers and statistics (e.g., "95% accuracy", "$2.4M savings")
- Write scannable bullet points (not sentences)
- Include visual suggestions for every content slide
- Use action verbs (Transform, Accelerate, Enhance)
- Make titles descriptive (tell the story without reading content)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Write paragraphs or long sentences
- Use more than 6 bullet points per slide
- Create generic titles ("Introduction", "Overview")
- Overcrowd slides with text
- Skip visual element suggestions

---
