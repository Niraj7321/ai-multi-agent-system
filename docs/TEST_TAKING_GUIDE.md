## 🎯 Negative Marking Strategy

### Understanding Negative Marks
- **Correct Answer**: +1 mark
- **Wrong Answer**: -0.25 marks
- **No Answer**: 0 marks

### When to Attempt
✅ **Attempt if:**
- You're 80%+ confident
- You can eliminate 2 options
- You have educated guess

❌ **Skip if:**
- Completely unsure
- All options seem equally correct/wrong
- High risk, low reward scenario

### Risk Calculation
To break even on guessing:
- You need to be right 1 out of 4 times
- If you can eliminate 2 options → 50% chance → Worth attempting
- If you can eliminate 1 option → 33% chance → Risky
